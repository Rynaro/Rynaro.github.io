# Spec — Rebrand Phase 0: Identity Spine & Canon
## ESL `specify` hop — per-phase projection of the frozen umbrella plan

> **GENERATED ARTIFACT — DO NOT HAND-EDIT. REGENERATE, NEVER RETYPE.**
> Every acceptance body below is a **byte-identical slice** of the frozen source
> `.claude/rebrand/rebrand.criteria.md` (sha256 `393f1e59...`), filtered through
> `.spectra/changes/rebrand/spec.yaml` `phases[0].acceptance`. The plan
> `.claude/rebrand/rebrand-plan.md` remains **the single source of truth**; where this file
> and the plan could disagree, **THE PLAN AND THE FROZEN CRITERIA FILE GOVERN**.
> A hand-edit here is drift, and is mechanically detectable by re-rendering this file from
> the frozen source and diffing.

**Defects addressed:** D10

## Dependencies

This phase **depends on nothing** — `depends_on: []`. It is the root of the DAG and
unblocks every other phase: Phases 1-5 all rest on the identity spine and the post-type
vocabulary established here.

**Ship order:** first. Nothing else may land before it.

> **"Independently shippable" would overstate it.** Every phase depends on Phase 0, directly
> or transitively. These six changes form a **DAG shippable in dependency order** — not in an
> arbitrary one. The dependency graph itself lives in
> `.spectra/changes/rebrand/spec.yaml` (`phases[].depends_on`), because `depends_on` has no
> home in the ESL `change.v1` schema; it is restated here in prose so that an executor
> reading only this folder cannot miss it.

## Invariants — carry these verbatim; they are hard-won

1. **Ruling 2 is justified on correctness + a11y + SEO, NEVER on speed.** The heaviest page
   ships **4,778 B gzipped**; there was never a performance problem. **Do not reintroduce any
   perf residue.** "Insight" licenses craft satisfaction, not speed claims.
2. **The retracted figures must never be published as fact:** `7,862 B`, `7.9 KB`, `17.8x`,
   `18.25x`. **Correct:** per-file sum **11,028 B**, heaviest page **4,778 B**, ratios
   **30.0x** / **13.0x**. **AC-059 greps the post for exactly the retracted four and fails on
   any hit.** They are named here **only as a prohibition, in a retraction record**, so that
   they stay out of the artifact. **Note:** FORGE's own `EC-4` text carries `18.25x`; it has
   been re-anchored to **30.0x** — do not let the retracted figure back in by copying EC-4's
   original wording.
3. **The Formspree form-hash ID is an owner-supplied credential** (`executor_resolvable:
   false`) — the contact-form story (Story 1.1 / D9) cannot complete without it. It is a
   **Phase 1** dependency.
4. **Phase 5 is optional and owner-gated**, hard-gated behind Phase 1 (**EC-1**), sequenced
   after Phase 4; **AC-053 requires a dated `go` record predating any `_opal/` commit**.
   Realistic disposition: **"probably not, and that is a fine outcome."**
5. **AC-024 does NOT discharge WCAG 2.2.2** — that is AC-031. `prefers-reduced-motion` is
   **not** a 2.2.2 mechanism. Two defects, two criteria, two phases.

## Acceptance

**3 criteria** — the frozen 59 partition across the six phases as
**3 / 12 / 7 / 7 / 19 / 11**, with zero overlap and zero gaps. Bodies below are verbatim
slices of the frozen source; headings carry the phase annotation from the frozen `spec.md`.

### AC-001 (ubiquitous)  ·  **Phase 0**
THEN the site SHALL define the canonical compound identity line in exactly one `_data` field consumed verbatim by the homepage hero, the About page, and the meta description
VERIFY: grep finds the identity string defined once under `_data/`; index.html, about.html, `_includes/head/meta.html` each reference that field

### AC-002 (ubiquitous)  ·  **Phase 0**
THEN the site SHALL present one canonical job title identically in `_data/character_build.yml` and `_data/jobs.yaml`, replacing the Director-of-Development vs Director-of-Engineering split
VERIFY: the job title in character_build.yml equals jobs.yaml[0].title; `grep -rn "Director of" _data` yields a single distinct title

### AC-003 (ubiquitous)  ·  **Phase 0**
THEN the repository SHALL document the five themed post-types as the closed set of allowed `type` front-matter values in a committed conventions file
VERIFY: a conventions doc enumerates {scroll, cantrip, log, distillation, transmutation} as the permitted `type:` values

## Provenance

- **Frozen source:** `.claude/rebrand/rebrand.criteria.md` — sha256 `393f1e5948ef9e55a9b3ca812c11034942d1c2b9b2e8a9f1655f0a3408335fe5`, **untouched** by
  this projection.
- **Phase map:** `.spectra/changes/rebrand/spec.yaml` `phases[0].acceptance`.
- **Plan of record:** `.claude/rebrand/rebrand-plan.md` v0.4.0 (frozen, APPROVE - executor-ready).
- **Umbrella:** `rebrand` — superseded by this change per `supersedes: rebrand`.
- **Projection:** mechanical filter + round-trip diff against the frozen source. No
  re-planning, no re-scoring, no new criteria.
