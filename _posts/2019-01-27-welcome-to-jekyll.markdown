Recently I’ve decided to return in my open source life. And this decision has direct
impact in this blog, because open source isn’t only about code, or metrics.
For me it’s about ideas, knowledge sharing, and good networking.

In this “notebook”, I will write (when I have a break) about my routine inside the
codes, inside the books (I really like to talk about J.R.R Tolkien books), and
whatever I want. :D

{% highlight ruby %}
puts 'later! :)'
#=> prints 'later! :)' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
