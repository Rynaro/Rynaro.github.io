Recently I’ve decided to return in my opensource life. And this decision has direct
impact in this blog, because opensource isn’t only about code, metrics, or test units.
For me it’s about ideas, knowledge sharing, and good networking.

I’ve looked at new technologies that I had a close contact, like Electron and I could
see the power of web technologies has today, and why these technologies needs more attention
by enterprises nowadays.

In this “notebook”, I will write (when I have a break) about my routine inside the
codes, inside the books (I really like to talk about J.R.R Tolkien books), and
whatever thread I want. :D
